Challenge 3: Decrypt the Classified Message

Congratulations on reaching Challenge 3!

Your objective is to decrypt the highly classified message intercepted from the enemy's communication channel. The encrypted message is provided in the attached file, "encrypted_message.txt".

Use your decryption skills and knowledge of cryptographic techniques to uncover the original message. You may need to try different decryption methods or analyze patterns within the message.

Here are some hints to guide you:

1. Analyze the ciphertext: Look for patterns, repeating sequences, or unusual characters that could provide clues about the encryption method used.
2. Experiment with different techniques: Try common decryption methods such as Caesar cipher, substitution cipher, or frequency analysis.
3. Use online tools: If needed, you can leverage online decryption tools or resources to assist you in the process.

Decrypt the message and capture a screenshot or save the decrypted text as evidence of your success.

Good luck, agent!
