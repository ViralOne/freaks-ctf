Continuing my co-worker research:

Eureka! In the realm of equations, I have discovered a formula that bridges the chasm between mundane reality and the wondrous realm of fusion energy. Behold:

Fusion Power (P) = ρf * V * (1 + β) * E

Here, the variables dance with elegance:

    ρf: Fusion fuel density, a testament to the concentration of cosmic essence (in kg/m^3).
    V: Volume of the containment chamber, the cosmic cradle that nurtures the fusion dance (in m^3).
    β: A factor representing the energy amplification achieved through the fusion reaction, like a phoenix rising from its own ashes.
    E: The energy released per fusion event, the heartbeat of the universe itself
