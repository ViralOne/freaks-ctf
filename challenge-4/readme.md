Explanation:
The `social_engineering.py` script simulates a social engineering attack by sending targeted questions to the target's URL and endpoint. The script uses the `requests` library to send POST requests with JSON payloads.

In the script, you can modify the `url` and `endpoint` variables to match the target's URL and the specific endpoint where the questions should be submitted.

The `backstory` variable represents a convincing backstory that the attacker can use to establish trust with the target. You can modify it to fit the context of your scenario.

The `questions` list contains targeted questions that the attacker wants to ask the target to extract sensitive information. Modify or add more questions as needed for your scenario.

The `perform_social_engineering` function iterates through the `questions` list, sends a POST request to the target's URL and endpoint, and prints the question and the response received from the server.

To run the script, make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using the following command:
```
pip install requests
```
Replace the `url` and `endpoint` variables with the appropriate values for your scenario, then execute the `social_engineering.py` script using Python. It will perform the social engineering attack by sending the questions to the target's endpoint and display the responses received.

Please note that this example script is for educational purposes only, and social engineering attacks are illegal and unethical without proper authorization and consent. Always ensure you adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when conducting any security-related activities.
