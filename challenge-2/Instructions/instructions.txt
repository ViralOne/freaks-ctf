Challenge 2: Web Application Vulnerabilities

Welcome to Challenge 2!

Your objective is to identify and exploit a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Example Web App.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Access the Example Web App: Visit the following URL [provide the URL or IP address] to access the web app.
2. Login: You can use any username and password to login; authentication is not enforced for this challenge.
3. Explore the app: After login, you will see a form where you can enter your name.
4. Exploit the XSS vulnerability: Inject malicious code into the name input field to execute a script and display an alert box with the text "XSS Exploited!".

Capture screenshots or save the necessary information as evidence of successful exploitation.

Good luck!
