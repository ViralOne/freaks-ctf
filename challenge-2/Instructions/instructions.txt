Challenge 2: Web Application Vulnerabilities

Welcome to Challenge 2!

Your objective is to identify and exploit a SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability in the XIPE Corp Workers webapp.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Access the Example Web App: Visit the URL from challenge 1 to access the web app.
2. Login: Use the provided login form on the web app. Enter a username and password of your choice. Note that the authentication mechanism is not enforced for this challenge.
3. Explore the app: Once logged in, you will see a message.
4. Exploit the SQLi vulnerability: Inject malicious SQL code into the username or password field to manipulate the query and bypass the authentication. Your goal is to log in as a different user or gain unauthorized access.
5. Capture screenshots or save the necessary information as evidence of successful exploitation.

Remember, the purpose of this challenge is to understand the risks associated with SQL injection vulnerabilities. Be responsible and avoid causing any harm to the web app or its users.

Good luck!
