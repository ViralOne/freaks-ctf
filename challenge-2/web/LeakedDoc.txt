A hacker from Hackervile, cunning and smart,
Using an Affine Cipher, he plays his part.
With a and b, encryption takes hold,
NASA and Pentagon breached, a story was told.

Crack the code, when the arrest was held,
Unveil the year, don't fall behind.
In digits hidden, seek with precision,
Look past the "20" without indecision.

Within this code, secrets lie concealed,
An enigma wrapped in a cryptographic shield.
Using SAML, it's been concealed,
Maybe it's hex maybe it's bin.

But that's not all, there's more to pursue,
A hidden clue in Base64, a hint so true.
Decode it well, a message will derive,
Leading to MD5, where secrets strive.

So take this challenge, let your mind unfold,
Solve the puzzle, let the story be told.
Crack the codes, unveil the tale,
And let your wisdom and knowledge prevail.
